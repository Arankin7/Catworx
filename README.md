## Description
A Command line application where users can create employee badges. 

## Installation
*  Clone the Repo to your machine.  Make sure that you have the .NET Core SDK installed on your computer. Refer to [the .NET documentation](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet) if you have any troubles.
*  Make sure you are in the root folder of the project, and in the command line run 'dotnet run'.  
*  The command line will ask if you would like to enter your own information.  Follow the prompts, and the employee badges will be created in a folder named 'data'.  

## Demo
This is a short video showing the application in action.  Here it pulls from [a random user API](https://www.randomuser.me) and populates the badges with that info.
